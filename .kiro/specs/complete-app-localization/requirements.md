# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to complete the thorough localization (Ukrainian-English language switching) throughout the entire IrrigAIte UA application workflow. The application currently has partial localization implemented with i18next, but many components, pages, and user interface elements remain hardcoded in English. This feature will ensure that all user-facing text, messages, labels, and content can be seamlessly switched between Ukrainian and English languages while maintaining the current app functionality and design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Ukrainian farmer, I want to view all application content in Ukrainian language, so that I can fully understand and use the irrigation calculator without language barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Ukrainian language THEN all navigation elements SHALL display in Ukrainian
2. WHEN a user selects Ukrainian language THEN all page content SHALL display in Ukrainian
3. WHEN a user selects Ukrainian language THEN all form labels and placeholders SHALL display in Ukrainian
4. WHEN a user selects Ukrainian language THEN all button text and interactive elements SHALL display in Ukrainian
5. WHEN a user selects Ukrainian language THEN all error messages and notifications SHALL display in Ukrainian
6. WHEN a user selects Ukrainian language THEN all tooltips and help text SHALL display in Ukrainian

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an English-speaking agricultural professional, I want to view all application content in English language, so that I can effectively use the irrigation tools and understand all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects English language THEN all navigation elements SHALL display in English
2. WHEN a user selects English language THEN all page content SHALL display in English
3. WHEN a user selects English language THEN all form labels and placeholders SHALL display in English
4. WHEN a user selects English language THEN all button text and interactive elements SHALL display in English
5. WHEN a user selects English language THEN all error messages and notifications SHALL display in English
6. WHEN a user selects English language THEN all tooltips and help text SHALL display in English

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language preference to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reselect my preferred language every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the preference SHALL be stored in localStorage
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the previously selected language SHALL be automatically applied
3. WHEN a user clears browser data THEN the application SHALL default to browser language detection
4. IF browser language is not supported THEN the application SHALL default to English

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all currently non-localized pages to support both languages, so that I have a consistent multilingual experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Landing page THEN all content SHALL be available in both languages
2. WHEN viewing the Guidelines page THEN all content SHALL be available in both languages
3. WHEN viewing the About page THEN all content SHALL be available in both languages
4. WHEN viewing the Support page THEN all content SHALL be available in both languages
5. WHEN viewing the Terms page THEN all content SHALL be available in both languages
6. WHEN viewing the Privacy page THEN all content SHALL be available in both languages
7. WHEN viewing the Reference Book page THEN all content SHALL be available in both languages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all form validation messages and dynamic content to be properly localized, so that I can understand system feedback in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form validation occurs THEN error messages SHALL display in the selected language
2. WHEN success messages are shown THEN they SHALL display in the selected language
3. WHEN loading states are displayed THEN loading text SHALL display in the selected language
4. WHEN confirmation dialogs appear THEN all dialog content SHALL display in the selected language
5. WHEN date and number formatting is used THEN it SHALL follow the selected locale conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the localization system to be maintainable and extensible, so that adding new content or languages in the future is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new text content is added THEN it SHALL use the translation system
2. WHEN translation keys are organized THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention
3. WHEN translation files are structured THEN they SHALL be logically organized by feature/page
4. WHEN missing translations occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to the key or English text
5. WHEN new namespaces are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured in the i18n setup

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the current application functionality and design to remain unchanged, so that the localization enhancement doesn't break existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localization is implemented THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN localization is implemented THEN the visual design SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN localization is implemented THEN component behavior SHALL remain the same
4. WHEN localization is implemented THEN routing and navigation SHALL work as before
5. WHEN localization is implemented THEN authentication flows SHALL remain functional
6. WHEN localization is implemented THEN data persistence SHALL continue to work
